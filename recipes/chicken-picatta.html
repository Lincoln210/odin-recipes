    <h3>Ingredients for Chicken Piccata</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Skinless, Boneless, Chicken Breast Halves</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>Salt and Ground Black Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour for Dredging</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Capers, Drained</li>
        <li>1/2 cup White Wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Cold Unsalted Butter Cut in 1/4 inch Slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Chopped Fresh Italian Parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
        <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
    </ol>
