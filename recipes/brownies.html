    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. They are <strong>rich</strong>, 
       <strong>fudgy in the middle</strong>, and made <strong>completely from scratch</strong>. 
       These brownies are so much better than the box, and I bet you 
       have what you need to make them already sitting in your kitchen.</p>

    <p>I <strong>love</strong> brownies that are <strong>rich</strong> and <strong>extra chocolatey</strong>. 
       These brownies with <strong>dense, fudgy middles</strong> and <strong>crinkly tops</strong> absolutely deliver!</p>
